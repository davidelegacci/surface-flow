- 1-parametric-surface-1-field.py plots the flow of one given vector field tangent to a given surface

- 2-parametric-surface-2-fields.py plots one integral curve of two given vector fields tangent to a given surface

- 3-frob-sym.py, given two commuting vector fields, plots a leaf of the integrable distribution they span, 
	computing __symbolocally__ the parametrization given by the composition of flows

5-frob-num.py given two commuting vector fields, plots a leaf of the integrable distribution they span, 
	computing __numerically__ the parametrization given by the composition of flows


figures contains an example plot resulting from each of these programs.
